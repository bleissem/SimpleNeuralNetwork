# Simple Neural Network in C#
## AI
A multi-layer perceptron (one input, one hidden and output), forward feed neural network with backward propagation and x number of neurons for each layer.
## Program.cs
Working example of how to train the Nueral Network to add to decimals. 

_Sigmoid as output function is in in the range of 0 to 1, so input/ouput data must me normalized to be lower than .1_

## Output after training
