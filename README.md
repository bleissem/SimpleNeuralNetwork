# Simple Neural Network in C#
## AI
A multi-layer perceptron (one input, one hidden and output), forward feed neural network with backward propagation and x number of neurons for each layer.
## Program.cs
Working example of training Nueral Network with few data to add to decimals
_Sigmoid as output funnction is in in the range [0-1], so input/ouput data must me lower than .1_
