# Simple Neural Network in C#
### AI
A multi-layer perceptron (one input, one hidden and output), forward feed neural network with backward propagation and x number of neurons for each layer.
### Trainers
Two trainers, for addition and XOR, with the ability to live train the neural network or load a trained data into the network.
### Math Methods
Two available methods, Sigmoid and HyperTan to try train the network and see the differences
### Program.cs
Working example of how to train the Nueral Network to add to decimals, or to load trained data.

_Sigmoid as output function is in in the range of 0 to 1, so input/ouput data must me normalized to be lower than .1_

## Output after training
